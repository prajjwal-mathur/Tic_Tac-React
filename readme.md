# TicTac React brush-up
- I went through a react tutorial on `react.dev` to brush-up my react knowledge.
- Recommended for anyone who wants to go through React basics.
- In this tictac tutorial:
    - Went through useState 
    > A pre-defined hook that updates and re-render a variable using 'setSomething' <br />`syntax: [something, setSomething] = useState(any_value_that_you want_to_initialize with)`
    - To use useState, just do this: `setSomething(something+1 or something+any_operation)`
    - Props: Variables that go as parameters to a function...sounds like PROPerty :)
    - Implemented immutability by using a spread function `[...variable] or variable.slice()`, it makes variable's copy in another variable.
